3) on chap 7.6 Undercloud node database backup there is a mention of
--db-only for openstack undercloud backup command, but never found it, also
inside /lib/python3.6/site-packages/tripleoclient/v1/undercloud_backup.py
This feature will be present in 16.2.2 => https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1977392

4) check TSX mode on computes; the advice is to switch to off,
but if was on on rhosp13/rhel7 live migration never occurs

5) Upgrade on controller fails multiple time due to rabbitmq and redis errors
bootstrap controller upgrade with no_tags has been ran 3 times
first time: got an exception on rabbitmq not running
second time: got an exception on nova-conductor not ready
### paunch --debug apply --file /var/lib/tripleo-config/container-startup-config/step_2 --config-id tripleo_step2 --managed-by tripleo-Controller
- second controller: I've been ran 5 times with same errors on rabbitmq at the
  end I've generated new selinux modules for granting writes on log dir to
  containers:
[root@controller-2 ~]# egrep '^allow' *.te
customContainerLog2.te:allow container_t container_log_t:dir { read setattr };
customContainerLog2.te:allow container_t container_log_t:file open;
customContainerLog3.te:allow container_t container_log_t:dir write;
customContainerLog3.te:allow container_t container_log_t:file ioctl;
customContainerLog.te:allow container_t container_log_t:file { append write };
After loading those modules I've removed all logs under /var/log/containers/rabbitmq/
rm rabbit\@controller-2.log*
rm rabbit\@controller-2_upgrade.log*
rm startup_log.*
- third controller: first run failed at step1
second run end with succes but rabbitmq and redis were stopped/failed => after
deploy I only ran "pcs resource cleanup"
